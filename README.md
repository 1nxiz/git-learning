## Hello!
After completing the course on git commands, I learnt a lot of commands that I didn't even know existed before: rebase, checkout, options of push, pull, and fetch. So, this course was really useful and I enjoyed it, even though it took a lot of time. Actualy all commands is usefull, so, for my mind, sooner or later I'll use them all

## Hi!

When I finished this course I understood many Git features. I discovered a lot of git commands and I think that it will help me in the future. Also I got to know how to use GitHub and I find it very useful and interesting. I want to improve my skills and hope that in the future I would be able to use all them all!
