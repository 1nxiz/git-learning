## Hello!
After completing the course on git commands, I learnt a lot of commands that I didn't even know existed before: rebase, checkout, options of push, pull, and fetch. So, this course was really useful and I enjoyed it, even though it took a lot of time. Actualy all commands is usefull, so, for my mind, sooner or later I'll use them all

I'm Biliakov Artem, CHnU student on my second year. And this is a message for the first lab on web-programming. Git is kinda cool, it's very functional and versatile. Overall I've liked learning more about it. And I think I'll use it at full potential someday.

As I have the right to write whatever I want, I'll leave my steam account page here, in case you want to play with someone. https://steamcommunity.com/id/BeliyDot/
I may not answer immediately, I can be busy, but maybe we can play one day.

That's all. Cya, sigmas.
